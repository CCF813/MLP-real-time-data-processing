# MLP Real-Time Data Processing

This project demonstrates the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for real-time data processing. The data is processed using a sliding window technique, and features are extracted from each window.

## Features
- Sliding window for real-time data processing
- Feature extraction (mean, max, min, std)
- MLP model for classification

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CCF813/MLP-real-time-data-processing.git
cd MLP-real-time-data-processing
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python mlp_real_time_data_processing.py
```
